Scientific Data Management Assignment 1 KMeans Clustering

## Way of approaching tasks
1. Everyone writes someone elses test cases
2. Everyone hardcodes expected outputs of their domain
3. Everyone takes the inputs and works on developing an output testing against test caes
4. Split the algorithm into the 2 models and 2 teams.
5. Train the models and tweak algorithm
6. Test and improve
7. Run against test set
8. Upload

## Team TODO List
1. Write testcases
2. Import data from txt and csv filetype into a pandas dataframe
3. Clean data if necessary?
4. display a summary of data and if k_clusters isn't defined then find optimal number for K (might not be necessary?)
5. Split data into training and test set potentially creating a case for time series
but can probably just leave that for now.
6. Initialise clusters creating the correct data structure for them and setting up the data for parallellisation if necessary?
7. Determine the initial observations.
8. Create our first recursive observation algorithm.
9. Print our result and a visual representation of it.


## TO FIND OUT
1. Will K always be given
2. Is speed important, should we be concerned with parallelisation? 
3.
